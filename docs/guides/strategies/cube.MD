# Cube Strat
- F2P Minimum required: 1 legendary 1 purple 1 blue
  - Higher legendary extremely important
  - purple/blue 6 is only +- ~3% more cube loot ea

- Optimal: 6 Legendary 6 Purple 1 Chalk
  - Sacrifices 10% cube loot for raw FE drops

## Special Strategies

- Manual Optimal: Swap to Captain Shadow + Chalk + Drop on boss room

### Cards (Run 6 blue instead of Chalk)
- `chance of desire crystal to be replicated once`
- `all monsters replaced with malice incarnations`
- `Malice incarnations have a chance to drop additional Desire Crystals`
- `When malice is accumulating, there is a chance for additional malice judges to appear`
- `chance of corner of divinity to drop with desire crystals`
    - Maybe don't need to run blue depending on how stacks are split
